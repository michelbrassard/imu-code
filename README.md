# IMU Code for the PDR project

Initial code for transmitting IMU information via a serial or Bluetooth connection.

Additional python scripts are added for testing.

NOTE: if the Arduino was powered off, and then powered on, UPLOAD the code AGAIN otherwise it won't work

## Steps

1. To run the code first upload the code to the Arduino from the ble_1_characteristic directory
2. Run the runner.py script in /central directory
3. Inside the "data" directory, IMU data will be found for each device
